                <p>Hi.</p><br>
                <p>My name is Michael.</p><br>
                <p>The site you are visiting holds some special memories of mine, containing many of my favorite photograhs. I originally started photography because it seemed like an easy 'A' for a class, an easy hobby, but it quickly grew into something more.  In only a few short months, I was eager to explore, capture something new, and spend more money on camera equipment!</p><br>
                <p>I am an amateur photogrpher, and my shots reflect that with their many technical flaws; regardless, I am still proud of my work.  Just trying to capture something from a perspective unseen ordinarily, is what interests me the most.</p><br>
                <p>The site is titled A Travelers Tale, due to a 6 month road trip I went on some years ago, most of the photos you will find here will be from that trip.  At the time I had a grand plan to share my adventures online, and even bought the domain!  Unfortunately I lacked the technical expertise, and the drive to learn how, to create a useful site at the time.  However for more than a year, programming and web development have become big interests of mine.  Having learned HTML, CSS, and various Javascript frameworks, I figured the time is right to return to the project and give it proper justice.</p>
